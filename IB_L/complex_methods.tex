\section{Introduction}
This is a methods course. By this, we mean we will not focus too much on proofs. We will at best just skim over the proofs. Instead, we focus on \emph{doing things}. We will not waste time proving things people have proved 300 years ago. If you like proofs, you can go to the IB Complex Analysis course, or look them up in relevant books.

\section{Analytic functions}
\subsection{The complex plane and the Riemann sphere}
We begin with a review of complex numbers. Any complex number $z \in \C$ can be written in the form $x + iy$, where $x = \Re z$, $y = \Im z$ are real numbers. We can also write it as $r e^{i\theta}$, where
\begin{defi}[Modulus and argument]
  The \emph{modulus} and \emph{argument} of a complex number $z = x + iy$ are given by
  \[
    r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \theta = \arg z,
  \]
  where $x \tan \theta = y$.
\end{defi}
The argument is defined only up to multiples of $2\pi$. So we define the following:
\begin{defi}[Principal value of argument]
  The \emph{principal value} of the argument is the value of $\theta$ in the range $(-\pi, \pi]$.
\end{defi}
Note that the formula $\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$ does not always give the right answer --- it is correct only if $x > 0$. If $x \leq 0$, then it might be out by $\pm \pi$ (eg. consider $z = 1 + i$ and $z = -1 - i$).

\begin{defi}[Open set]
  An \emph{open set} $\mathcal{D}$ is one which does not include its boundary. More technically, $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \C$ is open if for all $z_0 \in \mathcal{D}$, there is some $\delta > 0$ such that the disc $|z - z_0| < \delta$ is contained in $\mathcal{D}$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Neighbourhood]
  A \emph{neighbourhood} of a point $z \in \C$ is an open set containing $z$.
\end{defi}

\subsubsection*{The extended complex plane}
\begin{defi}[The extended complex plane]
  The \emph{extended complex plane} is $\C^* = \C \cup \{\infty\}$. We can reach the ``point at infinity'' by going off in any direction in the plane, and all are equivalent. In particular, there is no concept of $-\infty$. All infinities are the same. Operations with $\infty$ are done in the obvious way.
\end{defi}
Sometimes, we \emph{do} write down things like $-\infty$. This does not refer to a different point. Instead, this indicates a \emph{limiting process}. We mean we are approaching this infinity from the direction of the negative real axis. However, we still end up in the same place.

Conceptually, we can use the \emph{Riemann sphere}, which is a sphere resting on the complex plane with its ``South Pole'' $S$ at $z = 0$.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0, 0) -- (8, 0) -- (10, 3) -- (2, 3) -- (0, 0);
    \draw [gray] (1, 1.5) -- (9, 1.5);
    \draw [gray] (4, 0) -- (6, 3);
    \draw (5, 2.5) circle [radius=1.2];

    \node [circ] at (5, 1.5) {};
    \node at (5, 1.5) [right] {$S$};

    \node [circ] at (5, 3.5) {};
    \node at (5, 3.5) [right] {$N$};

    \node [circ] at (5.5, 2.8) {};
    \node at (5.5, 2.8) [right] {$P$};

    \draw (5, 3.5) -- (7, 0.7) node [circ] {} node [right] {$z$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For any point $z \in \C$, drawing a line through the ``North Pole'' $N$ of the sphere to $z$, and noting where this intersects the sphere. This specifies an equivalent point $P$ on the sphere. Then $\infty$ is equivalent to the North Pole of the sphere itself. So the extended complex plane is mapped bijectively to the sphere.

To investigate properties of $\infty$, we use the substitution $\zeta = \frac{1}{z}$. A function $f(z)$ is said to have a particular property \emph{at $\infty$} if $f(\frac{1}{\zeta})$ has that same property at $\zeta = 0$. This vague notion will be made precise when we have specific examples to play with.

\subsection{Complex differentiation}
Recall the definition of differentiation for a real function $f(x)$:
\[
  f'(x) = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \delta x) - f(x)}{\delta x}.
\]
It is implicit that the limit must be the same whichever direction we approach from. For example, consider $|x|$ at $x = 0$. If we approach from the right, ie. $\delta x \to 0^+$, then the limit is $+1$, whereas from the left, ie. $\delta x \to 0^-$, the limit is $-1$. Because these limits are different, we say that $|x|$ is not differentiable at the origin.

This is obvious and we already know that, but for complex differentiation, this issue is much more important, since there are many more directions. We now extend the definition of differentiation to complex number:
\begin{defi}[Complex differentiable function]
  A complex differentiable function $f: \C \to \C$ is \emph{differentiable} at $z$ if
  \[
    f'(z) = \lim_{\delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z + \delta z) - f(z)}{\delta z}
  \]
  exists (and is therefore independent of the direction of approach --- but now there are infinitely many possible directions).
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Analytic function]
  We say $f$ is \emph{analytic} at a point $z$ if there exists a neighbourhood of $z$ throughout which $f'$ exists. The terms \emph{regular} and \emph{holomorphic} are also used.
\end{defi}
In complex analysis, this sentence might be a few paragraphs long instead. Usually ``holomorphic'' is defined to mean the function has a Taylor series, but then we go on to prove that having a Taylor series is the same as being differentiable in a neighbourhood, ie. being holomorphic and analytic are the same.

\begin{defi}[Entire function]
  A complex function is \emph{entire} if it is analytic throughout $\C$.
\end{defi}

The property of analyticity is in fact a surprisingly strong one! For example, two consequences are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If a function is analytic, then it is differentiable infinitely many times. This is very \emph{very} false for real functions. There are real functions differentiable $N$ times, but no more (eg. by taking a non-differentiable function and integrating it $N$ times).
  \item A bounded entire function must be a constant.
\end{enumerate}
There are many more interesting properties, but these are sufficient to show us that complex differentiation is very different from real differentiation.
\subsubsection*{The Cauchy-Riemann equations}
We start by separating $f$ and $z$ into real and imaginary parts, ie.
\[
  f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),
\]
where $z = x + iy$ are $u, v$ are real functions.

We suppose that $f$ is differentiable at $z$. We may take $\delta z$ in any direction we like. First, we take it to be real, with $\delta z = \delta x$. Then
\begin{align*}
  f'(z) &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{f(z + \delta x) - f(z)}{\delta x}\\
  &= \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{u(x + \delta x, y) + iv(x + \delta x, y) - (u(x, y) + iv(x, y))}{\delta x}\\
  &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.
\end{align*}
What this says is something entirely obvious --- since we are allowed to take the limit in any direction, we can take it in the $x$ direction, and we get the corresponding partial derivative. This is a completely uninteresting point, and it is a good idea to end the lecture at an uninteresting point. Next lecture, we are going to do the really fascinating thing of taking the limit in the $y$ direction!
