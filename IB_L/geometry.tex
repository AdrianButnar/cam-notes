\section{Euclidean geometry}
We are first going to look at Euclidean geometry. Roughly, this is the geometry of $\R^n$ under the usual inner product and norm.

\begin{defi}[(Standard) inner product]
  The \emph{(standard) inner product} on $\R^n$ is defined by
  \[
    (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{y} = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i y_i.
  \]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Euclidean Norm]
  The \emph{Euclidean norm} of $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$ is
  \[
    \|\mathbf{x}\| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x})}.
  \]
  This defines a metric on $\R^n$ by
  \[
    d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\|.
  \]
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Isometry]
  A map $f: \R^n \to \R^n$ is an \emph{isometry} of $\R^n$ if
  \[
    d(f(\mathbf{x}), f(\mathbf{y})) = d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})
  \]
  for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \R^n$.
\end{defi}
Note that $f$ is not required to be linear.

We would like to see some examples of isometries. A good source of examples is matrices. Recall the following definition:
\begin{defi}[Orthogonal matrix]
  An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is \emph{orthogonal} if $AA^T = A^T A = I$.
\end{defi}

In general, for any matrix $A$ and $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \R^n$, we get
\[
  (A\mathbf{x}, A \mathbf{y}) = (A\mathbf{x})^T (A \mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x}^T A^T A \mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{x}, A^T A \mathbf{y}).
\]
So $A$ is orthogonal if and only if $(A\mathbf{x}, A\mathbf{y}) = (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \R^n$.

Recall also that the inner product can be expressed in terms of the norm by
\[
  (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{2}(\|\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{y}\|^2 - \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 -\|\mathbf{y}\|^2).
\]
So if $A$ preserves in norm, then it preserves the inner product, and the converse is obviously true. So $A$ is orthogonal if and only if $\|A\mathbf{x}\| = \|\mathbf{x}\|$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$. Hence matrices are orthogonal if and only if they are isometries.

More generally, let
\[
  f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}.
\]
Then
\[
  d(f(\mathbf{x}), f(\mathbf{y})) = \|A(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y})\|.
\]
So any $f$ of this form is an isometry if and only if $A$ is orthogonal. This is not too surprising. What might not be expected is that all isometries are of this form.

\begin{thm}
  Every isometry of $f: \R^n \to \R^n$ is of the form
  \[
    f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}.
  \]
  for $A$ orthogonal and $\mathbf{b} \in \R^n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let $f$ be an isometry. Let $\mathbf{e}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{e}_n$ be the standard basis of $\R^n$. Let
  \[
    \mathbf{b} = f(\mathbf{0}), \quad \mathbf{a}_i = f(\mathbf{e}_i) - \mathbf{b}.
  \]
  The idea is to construct our matrix $A$ out of these $\mathbf{a}_i$. For $A$ to be orthogonal, $\{\mathbf{a}_i\}$ must be an orthonormal basis.

  Indeed, we can compute
  \[
    \|\mathbf{a}_i\| = \|\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{e}_i) - f(\mathbf{0})\| = d(f(\mathbf{e}_i), f(\mathbf{0})) = d(\mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{0}) = \|\mathbf{e}_i\| = 1.
  \]
  For $i \not = j$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    (\mathbf{a}_i, \mathbf{a}_j) &= -(\mathbf{a}_i, -\mathbf{a}_j) \\
    &=-\frac{1}{2}(\|\mathbf{a}_i - \mathbf{a}_j\|^2 - \|\mathbf{a}_i\|^2 - \mathbf{a}_j\|^2)\\
    &= -\frac{1}{2}(\|f(\mathbf{e}_i) - f(\mathbf{e}_j)\|^2 - 2)\\
    &= -\frac{1}{2}(\|\mathbf{e}_i - \mathbf{e}_j\|^2 - 2)\\
    &= 0
  \end{align*}
  So $\mathbf{a}_i$ and $\mathbf{a}_j$ are orthogonal. In other words, $\{\mathbf{a}_i\}$ forms an orthonormal set. It is an easy result that any orthogonal set must be linearly independent. Since we have found $n$ orthonormal vectors, they form an orthonormal basis.

  Hence, the matrix $A$ with columns given by the column vectors $\mathbf{a}_i$ is an orthogonal matrix. We define a new isometry
  \[
    g(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}.
  \]
  We want to show $f = g$. By construction, we know $g(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{x})$ is true for $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{e}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{e}_n$.

  We observe that $g$ is invertible. In particular,
  \[
    g^{-1}(\mathbf{x}) = A^{-1}(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{b}) = A^T \mathbf{x} - A^T\mathbf{b}.
  \]
  Moreover, it is an isometry.

  We define
  \[
    h = g^{-1}\circ f.
  \]
  Since it is a composition of isometries, it is also an isometry. Moreover, it fixes $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{e}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{e}_n$.

  It currently suffices to prove that $h$ is the identity.

  Let $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$, and expand it in the basis as
  \[
    \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i \mathbf{e}_i.
  \]
  Let
  \[
    \mathbf{y} = h(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \mathbf{e}_i.
  \]
  We can compute
  \begin{align*}
    d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}_i)^2 &= (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{e}_i) = \|\mathbf{x}\|^2 + 1 - 2 x_i\\
    d(\mathbf{x}, 0)^2 &= \|\mathbf{x}\|^2.
  \end{align*}
  Similarly, we have
  \begin{align*}
    d(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{e}_i)^2 &= (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{e}_i, \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{e}_i) = \|\mathbf{y}\|^2 + 1 - 2 y_i\\
    d(\mathbf{y}, 0)^2 &= \|\mathbf{y}\|^2.
  \end{align*}
  Since $h$ is an isometry and fixes $\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{e}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{e}_n$, and by definition $h(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{y}$, we must have
  \[
    d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0}) = d(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{0}), \quad d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{e}_i) = d(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{e}_i).
  \]
  These give $\|\mathbf{x}\|^2 = \|\mathbf{y}\|^2$, and hence $x_i = y_i$ for all $i$. In other words, $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y} = h(\mathbf{x})$. So $h$ is the identity.
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Isometry group]
  The \emph{isometry group} $\Isom(\R^n)$ is the group of all isometries of $\R^n$, which is a group by composition.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}[Reflections in an affine hyperplane]
  Let $H \subseteq \R^n$ be an affine hyperplane given by
  \[
    H = \{\mathbf{x} \in \R^n: \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{x} = c\},
  \]
  where $\|\mathbf{u}\| = 1$ and $c \in \R$. This is just a natural generalization of a 2-dimensional plane in $\R^3$. Note that unlike a vector subspace, it does not have to contain the origin.

  Reflection in $H$, written $R_H$, is the map
  \begin{align*}
    R_H: \R^n &\to \R^n\\
    \mathbf{x} &\mapsto \mathbf{x} - 2(\mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{u} - c)\mathbf{u}
  \end{align*}
  It is an exercise in the example sheet to show that this is indeed an isometry.

  We now check this is indeed what we think a reflection should be. Note that every point in $\R^n$ can be written as $\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{u}$, where $\mathbf{a} \in H$. Then the reflection should send this point to $\mathbf{a} - t\mathbf{u}$.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node [circ] at (0, -2) {};
      \node [anchor = north east] at (0, -2) {$\mathbf{0}$};
      \draw [->] (0, -2) -- (3.5, 1) node [right] {$\mathbf{a}$};
      \draw [->] (3.5, 1) -- +(0, -1.5) node [below] {$\mathbf{a} - t\mathbf{u}$};
      \draw [fill=mblue, fill opacity=0.7] (0, 0) -- (5, 0) -- (7, 2) node [right] {$H$} -- (2, 2) -- cycle;
      \draw [->] (3.5, 1) -- +(0, 1.5) node [above] {$\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{u}$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  This is a routine check:
  \[
    R_H (\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{u}) = (\mathbf{a} + t\mathbf{u}) - 2t\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{a} - t\mathbf{u}.
  \]
  In particular, we know $R_H$ fixes exactly the points of $H$.

  The converse is also true --- any isometry $S \in \Isom(\R^n)$ that fixes the points in some affine hyperplane $H$ is either the identity or $R_H$.

  First, we want to translate the plane such that it becomes a vector subspace. Then we can use our linear algebra magic. For any $\mathbf{a} \in \R^n$, we can define the translation by $\mathbf{a}$ as
  \[
    T_{\mathbf{a}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{a}.
  \]
  This is clearly an isometry.

  We pick an arbitrary $\mathbf{a} \in H$, and let $R = T_{-\mathbf{a}} S T_\mathbf{a} \in \Isom(\R^n)$. Then $R$ fixes exactly $H' = T_{-\mathbf{a}} H$. Since $\mathbf{0} \in H'$, $H'$ is a vector subspace. In particular, if $H = \{\mathbf{x}: \mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{u} = c\}$, then by putting $c = \mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{u}$, we find
  \[
    H' = \{\mathbf{x}: \mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{u} = 0\}.
  \]
  To understand $R$, we already know it fixes everything in $H'$. So we want to see what it does to $\mathbf{u}$. Note that since $R$ is an isometry and fixes the origin, it is in fact an orthogonal map. Hence for any $\mathbf{x} \in H'$, we get
  \[
    (R\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x}) = (R\mathbf{u}, R\mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x}) = 0.
  \]
  So $R\mathbf{u}$ is also perpendicular to $H'$. Hence $R\mathbf{u} = \lambda \mathbf{u}$ for some $\lambda$. Since $R$ is an isometry, we have $\|R\mathbf{u}\|^2 = 1$. Hence $|\lambda|^2 = 1$, and thus $\lambda = \pm 1$. So either $\lambda = 1$, and $R = \id$; or $\lambda = -1$, and $R = R_{H'}$, as we already know for orthogonal matrices.

  It thus follow that $S = \id_{\R^n}$, or $S$ is a reflection, as we will show in the next lecture.
