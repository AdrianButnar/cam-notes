{\small
\noindent\textbf{Uniform convergence}\\
The general principle of uniform convergence. A uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.  Uniform convergence and termwise integration and differentiation of series of real-valued functions. Local uniform convergence of power series.\hspace*{\fill} [3]

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textbf{Uniform continuity and integration}\\
Continuous functions on closed bounded intervals are uniformly continuous. Review of basic facts on Riemann integration (from Analysis I). Informal discussion of integration of complex-valued and $\R^n$-valued functions of one variable; proof that $\|\int_a^b f(x) \;\d x\| \leq \int_a^b \|f(x)\|\;\d x$.\hspace*{\fill} [2]

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textbf{$\R^n$ as a normed space}\\
Definition of a normed space. Examples, including the Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ and the uniform norm on $\mathcal{C}[a, b]$. Lipschitz mappings and Lipschitz equivalence of norms. The Bolzanoâ€“Weierstrass theorem in $\R^n$. Completeness. Open and closed sets. Continuity for functions between normed spaces. A continuous function on a closed bounded set in $\R^n$ is uniformly continuous and has closed bounded image. All norms on a finite-dimensional space are Lipschitz equivalent.\hspace*{\fill} [5]

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textbf{Differentiation from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$}\\
Definition of derivative as a linear map; elementary properties, the chain rule. Partial derivatives; continuous partial derivatives imply differentiability. Higher-order derivatives; symmetry of mixed partial derivatives (assumed continuous). Taylor's theorem. The mean value inequality. Path-connectedness for subsets of $\R^n$; a function having zero derivative on a path-connected open subset is constant.\hspace*{\fill} [6]

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textbf{Metric spaces}\\
Definition and examples. *Metrics used in Geometry*. Limits, continuity, balls, neighbourhoods, open and closed sets.\hspace*{\fill} [4]

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textbf{The Contraction Mapping Theorem}\\
The contraction mapping theorem. Applications including the inverse function theorem (proof of continuity of inverse function, statement of differentiability). Picard's solution of differential equations.\hspace*{\fill} [4]}
