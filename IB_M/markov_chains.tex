\maketitle
{\small
\noindent\textbf{Discrete-time chains}\\
Definition and basic properties, the transition matrix. Calculation of $n$-step transition probabilities. Communicating classes, closed classes, absorption, irreducibility. Calculation of hitting probabilities and mean hitting times; survival probability for birth and death chains. Stopping times and statement of the strong Markov property.\hspace*{\fill} [5]

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent Recurrence and transience; equivalence of transience and summability of $n$-step transition probabilities; equivalence of recurrence and certainty of return. Recurrence as a class property, relation with closed classes. Simple random walks in dimensions one, two and three.\hspace*{\fill} [3]

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent Invariant distributions, statement of existence and uniqueness up to constant multiples. Mean return time, positive recurrence; equivalence of positive recurrence and the existence of an invariant distribution. Convergence to equilibrium for irreducible, positive recurrent, aperiodic chains *and proof by coupling*. Long-run proportion of time spent in a given state.\hspace*{\fill} [3]

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent Time reversal, detailed balance, reversibility, random walk on a graph.\hspace*{\fill} [1]}
