This course aims to provide a survey of topics relevant to research in 3-manifold topology and geometry.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Knots and links.} Invariants of knots and links, including the Jones and Alexander polynomials. Categorification of invariants. Dehn filling and Dehn surgery.
 \item \textit{Geometrization and Hyperbolic geometry.} A survey, mostly without proof, of primary notions from geometrization --- which characterizes 3-manifold geometry and topology in terms of the fundamental group --- and hyperbolic geometry.
 \item \textit{3-manifold constructions.} Mapping tori, handle decompositions, Heegaard splittings, triangulations.
 \item \textit{Foliations.} Singular, Reeb, and taut foliations, with connections to fundamental group actions, topology, and geometry. Transverse foliations on Seifert fibred spaces
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
Part III Algebraic Topology and Part III Differential Geometry.
