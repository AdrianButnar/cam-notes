This class aims at giving an introduction to the theory of divisors, linear systems and their positivity properties on projective algebraic varieties.

The first part of the class will be dedicated to introducing the basic notions and results regarding these objects and special attention will be devoted to discussing examples in the case of curves and surfaces.

In the second part, the course will cover classical results from the theory of divisors and linear systems and their applications to the study of the geometry of algebraic varieties.

If time allows and based on the interests of the participants, there are a number of more advanced topics that could possibly be covered: Reider's Theorem for surfaces, geometry of linear systems on higher dimensional varieties, multiplier ideal sheaves and invariance of plurigenera, higher dimensional birational geometry.

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
The minimum requirement for those students wishing to enroll in this class is their knowledge of basic concepts from the Algebraic Geometry Part 3 course, i.e.\ roughly Chapters 2 and 3 of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry.

Familiarity with the basic concepts of the geometry of algebraic varieties of dimension 1 and 2 --- e.g.\ as covered in the preliminary sections of Chapters 4 and 5 of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry --- would be useful but will not be assumed --- besides what was already covered in the Michaelmas lectures.

Students should have also some familiarity with concepts covered in the Algebraic Topology Part 3 course such as cohomology, duality and characteristic classes.
