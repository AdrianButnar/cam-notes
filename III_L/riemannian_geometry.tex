\section{Basics of Riemannian manifolds}
This will be a very brief summary of some topics in the Michaelmas Differential Geometry course.

\begin{defi}[Riemannian metric]
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A \term{Riemannian metric} $g$ on $M$ is an inner product on the tangent bundle $TM$ varying smoothly with the fibers. Formally, this is a global section of $T^*M \otimes T^*M$ that is fiberwise symmetric and positive definite.

  The pair $(M, g)$ is called a \term{Riemannian manifold}.
\end{defi}

On every coordinate neighbourhood with coordinates $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n)$, we can write
\[
  g = \sum_{i, j = 1}^n g_{ij}(x)\;\d x_i \d x_j,
\]
and we can find the coefficients $g_{ij}$ by
\[
  g_{ij} = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right)
\]
and are $C^\infty$ functions.

\begin{eg}
  The manifold $\R^k$ has a canonical metric given by the Euclidean metric. In the usual coordinates, $g$ is given by $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$.
\end{eg}

Does every manifold admit a metric? Recall

\begin{thm}[Whitney embedding theorem]\index{Whitney embedding theorem}
  Every smooth manifold $M$ admits an embedding into $\R^k$ for some $k$. In other words, $M$ is diffeomorphic to a submanifold of $\R^k$. In fact, we can pick $k$ such that $k \leq 2 \dim M$.
\end{thm}

Using such an embedding, we can induce a Riemannian metric on $M$ by restricting the inner product from Euclidean space, since we have inclusions $T_pM \hookrightarrow T_p \R^k \cong \R^k$.

More generally,
\begin{lemma}
  Let $(N, h)$ is a Riemannian manifold, and $F: M \to N$ is an immersion, then the pullback $g = F^*h$ defines a metric on $M$.
\end{lemma}
The condition of immersion is required for the pullback to be non-degenerate.

In Differential Geometry, if we do not have metrics, then we tend to consider diffeomorphic spaces as being the same. With metrics, the natural notion of isomorphism is
\begin{defi}[Isometry]\index{isometry}
  Let $(M, g)$ and $(N, h)$ be Riemannian manifolds. We say $f: M \to N$ is an \emph{isometry} if it is a diffeomorphism and $f^*h = g$. In other words, for any $p \in M$ and $u, v \in T_p M$, we need
  \[
    h\big((\d f)_p u, (\d f)_p v\big) = g(u, v).
  \]
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
  Let $G$ be a Lie group. Then for any $x$, we have translation maps $L_x, R_x: G \to G$ given by
  \begin{align*}
    L_x(y) &= xy\\
    R_x(y) &= yx
  \end{align*}
  These maps are in fact diffeomorphisms of $G$.

  We already know that $G$ admits a Riemannian metric, but we might want to ask something stronger --- does there exist a \term{left-invariant metric?} In other words, is there a metric such that each $L_x$ is an isometry?

  Recall that we previously had techniques to produce left-invariant vector fields, where a vector field $X$ on $G$ is \emph{left-invariant} if for any $x \in G$, we have $\d (L_x) X = X$.

  Given a Lie group $G$, we can define the \term{Lie algebra} $\mathfrak{g} = T_e G$. Then we can produce left-invariant vector fields by picking some $X_e \in \mathfrak{g}$, and then setting
  \[
    X_a = \d (L_a) X_e.
  \]
  The resulting vector field is indeed smooth, as shown in the differential geometry course.

  Similarly, to construct a left-invariant metric, we can just pick a metric at the identity and the propagating it around using left-translation. More explicitly, given any inner product on $\bra \ph, \ph\ket$ on $T_eG$, we can define $g$ by
  \[
    g(u, v) = \bra (\d L_{x^{-1}})_x u, (\d L_{x^{-1}})_x v\ket
  \]
  for all $x \in G$ and $u, v \in T_x G$. The argument for smoothness is similar to that for vector fields.
\end{eg}
Of course, everything works when we replace ``left'' with ``right''. A Riemannian metric is said to be \emph{bi-invariant}\index{bi-invariant metric} if it is both left- and right-invariant. These are harder to find, but it is a fact that every compact Lie group admits a bi-invariant metric. The basic idea of the proof is to start from a left-invariant metric, then integrate the metric along right translations of all group elements. Here compactness is necessary for the result to be finite.

We will later see that we cannot drop the compactness condition. There are non-compact Lie groups that do not admit bi-invariant metrics, such as $\SL(2, \R)$.

Recall that in order to differentiate vectors, or even tensors on a manifold, we needed a connection on the tangent bundle. There is a natural choice for the connection when we are given a Riemannian metric.
\begin{defi}[Levi-Civita connection]\index{Levi-Civita connection}
  Let $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. The \emph{Levi-Civita connection} is the unique connection $\nabla: \Omega^0_M(TM) \to \Omega^1_M(TM)$ on $M$ satisfying
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Compatibility with metric:\index{compatible connection}\index{connection!compatible with metric}
      \[
        Z g(X, Y) = g(\nabla_Z X, Y) + g(X, \nabla_Z Y),
      \]
    \item Symmetry/torsion-free:\index{symmetric connection}\index{torsion-free connection}\index{connection!symmetric}\index{connection!torsion-free}
      \[
        \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X, Y].
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
With a bit more imagination on what the symbols mean, we can write the first property as
\[
  \d (g(X, Y)) = g(\nabla X, Y) + g(X, \nabla Y),
\]
while the second property can be expressed in coordinate representation by
\[
  \Gamma_{jk}^i = \Gamma_{kj}^i,
\]
where $\Gamma_{jk}^i$ is defined by
\[
  \nabla_{\partial/\partial x_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k} = \sum_{i = 1}^n \Gamma_{jk}^i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}.
\]
In fact, the connection allows us to differentiate many more things, and not just tangent vectors.

Firstly, the connection $\nabla$ induces a unique covariant derivative on $T^*M$, also denoted $\nabla$, given by
\[
  X\bra \alpha, Y\ket = \bra \nabla_X \alpha , Y\ket + \bra \alpha, \nabla_X Y\ket
\]
for any $X,Y \in \Vect(M)$ and $\alpha \in \Omega^1(M)$.

To extend this to a connection $\nabla$ on tensor bundles $\mathcal{T}^{q, p} \equiv (TM)^{\otimes q} \otimes (T^*M)^{\otimes p}$\index{$\mathcal{T}^{q, p}M$} for any $p, q \geq 0$, we note the following general construction:

In general, suppose we have vector bundles $E$ and $F$, and $s_1 \in \Gamma(E)$ and $s_2 \in \Gamma(F)$. If we have connections $\nabla^E$ and $\nabla^F$ on $E$ and $F$ respectively, then we can define
\[
  \nabla^{E\otimes F} (s_1 \otimes s_2) = (\nabla^E s_1) \otimes s_2 + s_1 \otimes (\nabla^F s_2).
\]
Given this machinery, recall that the Riemannian metric is formally a section $g \in \Gamma(T^*M \otimes T^*M)$. Then the compatibility with the metric can be written in the following even more compact form:
\[
  \nabla g = 0.
\]

\section{Riemann curvature}
With all those definitions out of the way, we now start by studying the notion of \emph{curvature}. Students who did General Relativity would probably be very familiar with this Riemann curvature tensor.

Given a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ we have a Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ of $g$. We can define the curvature as follows:
\begin{defi}[Curvature]\index{curvature}\index{curvature 2-form}
  Let $(M, g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$. The \emph{curvature $2$-form} is the section
  \[
    R = - \nabla \circ \nabla \in \Gamma(\Lambda^2 T^*M \otimes T^*M \otimes TM) \subseteq \Gamma(\mathcal{T}^{1, 3}M).
  \]
\end{defi}
This can be thought of as a $2$-form with values in $T^*M \otimes TM = \End(TM)$. Given any $X, Y \in \Vect(M)$, we have
\[
  R(X, Y) \in \Gamma(\End TM) .
\]
One can check directly from definition that we can compute
\[
  R(X, Y) = \nabla_{[X, Y]} - [\nabla X, \nabla Y].
\]
One can also show that locally, we can write
\[
  R = -(\d A + A \wedge A),
\]
where $A$ is some quantity derived from the connection.

In local coordinates, we can write
\[
  R = \left(\sum_{k, \ell} R^i_{j, k\ell} \d x^k \d x^\ell\right)_{i, j = 1, \ldots, \dim M} \in R \in \Omega_M^2(\End(TM)).
\]
The comma between $j$ and $k\ell$ is purely for artistic reasons.

This is sometimes called the \term{curvature operator}. Again in local coordinates, we have
\[
  R(X, Y)^i_j = \sum_{k, \ell} R^i_{j, k\ell} X^k Y^\ell,
\]
where
\[
  X = \sum X^k \frac{\partial}{\partial x_k},\quad Y = \sum Y^\ell \frac{\partial}{\partial x_\ell}.
\]
To make life easier, we introduce the following short hands:
\begin{notation}
  In local coordinates, we will write $\partial_k$ for $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}$\index{$\partial_k$}, and $\nabla_k = \nabla_{\partial_k}$
\end{notation}

It is often slightly convenient to consider a different form of the Riemann curvature tensor. Instead of having a tensor of type $(1, 3)$, we have one of type $(0, 4)$ by
\[
  R(X, Y, Z, T) = g(R(X, Y)Z, T)
\]
for $X, Y, Z, T \in T_p M$. In local coordinates, we write this as
\[
  R_{ij, k\ell} = \sum_q g_{iq} R^q_{j, k\ell}.
\]
The first thing we want to prove is that $R_{ij, \ell}$ enjoys some symmetries we might not expect:
\begin{prop}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      \[
        R_{ij, k\ell} = - R_{ij, \ell k} = - R_{ji, k\ell}.
      \]
    \item The \term{first Bianchi identity}\index{Bianchi identity!first}
      \[
        R^i_{j, k \ell} + R^i_{k, \ell j} + R^i_{\ell, jk} = 0.
      \]
    \item
      \[
        R_{ij, k\ell} = R_{k\ell, ij}.
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
Note that the first Bianchi identity can also be written for the $(0, 4)$ tensor as
\[
  R_{ij, k\ell} + R_{ik, \ell j} + R_{i\ell, jk} = 0.
\]
We'll first prove these, and discuss a little bit what these mean.

\begin{proof}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The first equality is obvious as coefficients of a $2$-form. For the second equality, we note that the compatibility of the connection with the metric means
      \[
        \frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x_k} = g(\nabla_k \partial_i, \partial_j) + g(\partial_i, \nabla_k, \partial_j).
      \]
      We take a partial derivative, say with respect to $x_\ell$, to obtain
      \[
        \frac{\partial^2 g_{ij}}{\partial x_\ell \partial x_k} = g(\nabla_\ell \nabla_k \partial_i, \partial_j) + g(\nabla_k \partial_i, \nabla_\ell \partial_j) + g(\nabla_\ell \partial_i, \nabla_k \partial_j) + g(\partial_i, \nabla_\ell \nabla_k \partial_j).
      \]
      Then we know
      \[
        0 = \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial x_\ell \partial x_k} - \frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial x_k \partial x_\ell} = g([\nabla_\ell, \nabla_k] \partial_i, \partial_j) + g([\partial_\ell, \nabla_k]\partial_j).
      \]
      But we know
      \[
        R(\partial_k, \partial_\ell) = \nabla_{[\partial_k, \partial_\ell]} - [\nabla_k, \nabla_\ell] = -[\nabla_k, \nabla_\ell].
      \]
      Writing $R_{k\ell} = R(\partial_k, \partial_\ell)$, we have
      \[
        0 = g(R_{k\ell} \partial_i, \partial_j) + g(\partial_i, R_{k\ell} \partial_j) = R_{ji, k\ell} + R_{ij, k\ell}.
      \]
      So we are done.
    \item We now prove the first Bianchi identity. Recall
      \[
        R^i_{j, k\ell} = (R_{k\ell}, \partial_j)^i = ([\nabla_\ell, \nabla_k] \partial_j)^i.
      \]
      So we have
      \begin{align*}
        &\hphantom{={}}R^i_{j, k\ell} + R^i_{k, \ell j} + R^i_{\ell, jk}\\
        &= \left[(\nabla_\ell \nabla_k \partial_j - \nabla_k \nabla_\ell \partial_j) + (\nabla_j \nabla_\ell \partial_k - \nabla_\ell \nabla_j \partial_k) + (\nabla_k \nabla_j \partial_\ell - \nabla_j \nabla_k \partial_\ell)\right]^i.
      \end{align*}
      We claim that
      \[
        \nabla_\ell \nabla_k \partial_j - \nabla_\ell \nabla_j \partial_k = 0.
      \]
      Indeed, by definition, we have
      \[
        (\nabla_k \partial_j)^q = \Gamma_{kj}^q = \Gamma_{jk}^q = (\nabla_j \partial_k)^q.
      \]
      The other terms cancel similarly, and we get $0$ as promised.
    \item Consider the following octahedron:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
          \node [circ] (se) at (1.5, 0) {};
          \node [circ] (sw) at (0, 0) {};
          \node [circ] (ne) at (2.5, 0.7) {};
          \node [circ] (nw) at (1, 0.7) {};
          \node [circ] (top) at (1.25, 1.7) {};
          \node [circ] (bot) at (1.25, -1) {};

          \draw (sw) node [left] {\small $R_{ik, \ell j} = R_{ki, j\ell}$} -- (se) node [right] {\;\;\;\;\;\;\small $R_{i\ell, jk} = R_{\ell i, kj}$} -- (ne) node [right] {\small $R_{j\ell, ki} = R_{\ell j, ik}$} -- (nw) node [left] {\small $R_{jk, i\ell} = R_{kj, \ell i}$\;\;\;\;\;\;} -- (sw);

          \node [above] at (top) {\small $R_{ij, k\ell} = R_{ji, \ell k}$};
          \node [below] at (bot) {\small $R_{k\ell, ij} = R_{\ell k, ji}$};

          \draw (top) -- (sw) -- (bot);
          \draw (top) -- (se) -- (bot);
          \draw (top) -- (ne) -- (bot);

          \draw (top) -- (nw);
          \draw [dashed] (nw) -- (bot);

          \fill [opacity=0.3, gray] (top) -- (1.5, 0) -- (0, 0) -- (top);
          \fill [opacity=0.3, gray] (top) -- (2.5, 0.7) -- (1, 0.7) -- (top);

          \fill [opacity=0.3, gray] (bot) -- (1.5, 0) -- (2.5, 0.7) -- (bot);
          \fill [opacity=0.3, gray] (bot) -- (0, 0) -- (1, 0.7) -- (bot);
        \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}
      The equalities on each vertex is given by (i). By the first Bianchi idnetity, for each greyed triangle, the sum of the three vertices is zero.

      Now looking at the upper half of the octahedron, adding the two greyed triangles shows us the sum of the vertices in the horizontal square is $(-2) R_{ij, k\ell}$. Looking at the bottom half, we find that the sum of the vertices in the horizontal square is $(-2)R_{k\ell, ij}$. So we must have
      \[
        R_{ij, k\ell} = R_{k\ell, ij}.
      \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
What exactly are the properties of the Levi-Civita connection that make these equality works? The first equality of (i) did not require anything. The second equality of (i) required the compatibility with the metric, and (ii) required the symmetric property. The last one required both properties.

We can express the last property as saying $R_{ij, k\ell}$ is a symmetric bilinear form on $\Lambda^2 T_p^*M$. It is a straightforward exercise to rewrite the statement of this proposition in coordinate free notation using test vector fields. For example, the first equality in (i) can be written as
\[
  R(X, Y) = -R(Y, X).
\]
\subsection{Sectional curvature}
Recall that if we had tangent vectors $X, Y$, then we can form
\[
  |X \wedge Y| = \sqrt{g(X, X)g(Y, Y) - g(X, Y)^2},
\]
which is the area of the parallelogram spanned by $X$ and $Y$. We now define
\[
  K(X, Y) = \frac{R(X, Y, X, Y)}{|X \wedge Y|^2}.
\]
Note that this is invariant under (non-zero) scaling of $X$ or $Y$, and is symmetric in $X$ and $Y$. Finally, it is also invariant under the transformation $(X, Y) \mapsto (X + \lambda Y, Y)$.

But it is an easy linear algebra fact that these transformations generate all isomorphism from a two-dimensional vector space to itself. So $K(X, Y)$ depends only on the $2$-plane spanned by $X, Y$. So we have in fact defined a function on the Grassmannian of $2$-planes, $K: \Gr(2, T_p M) \to \R$. This is called the \term{sectional curvature} (of $g$).

It turns out the sectional curvature determines the Riemann curvature tensor completely!
\begin{lemma}
  Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $\geq 2$. Suppose $R', R'': V^{\otimes 4} \to \R$ are both linear in each factor, and satisfies the symmetries we found for the Riemann curvature tensor. We define $K', K'': \Gr(2, V) \to \R$ as in the sectional curvature. If $K' = K''$, then $R' = R''$.
\end{lemma}
This is really just linear algebra.
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
