\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Brownian motion.} Existence and sample path properties.
 \item \textit{Stochastic calculus for continuous processes.} Martingales, local martingales, semi-martingales, quadratic variation and cross-variation, It\^o's isometry, definition of the stochastic integral, Kunita-Watanabe theorem, and It\^o's formula.
 \item \textit{Applications to Brownian motion and martingales.} L\'evy characterization of Brownian motion, Dubins-Schwartz theorem, martingale representation, Girsanov theorem, conformal invariance of planar Brownian motion, and Dirichlet problems.
 \item \textit{Stochastic differential equations.} Strong and weak solutions, notions of existence and uniqueness, Yamada--Watanabe theorem, strong Markov property, and relation to second order partial differential equations.
 \item \textit{Stroock--Varadhan theory}. Diffusions, martingale problems, equivalence with SDEs, approximations of diffusions by Markov chains.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
Knowledge of measure theoretic probability as taught in Part III Advanced Probability will be assumed, in particular familiarity with discrete-time martingales and Brownian motion.
