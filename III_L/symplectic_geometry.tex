The fist part of the course will be an overview of the basic structures of symplectic geometry, including symplectic linear algebra, symplectic manifolds, symplectomorphisms, Darboux theorem, cotangent bundles, Lagrangian submanifolds, and Hamiltonian systems. The course will then go further into two topics. The first one is moment maps and toric symplectic manifolds, and the second one is capacities and symplectic embedding problems.
\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
Some familiarity with basic notions from Differential Geometry and Algebraic Topology will be assumed. The material covered in the respective Michaelmas Term courses would be more than enough background.
