The fundamental group of the circle; topological proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. *Construction of the universal covering of a path-connected, locally simply connected space*. The correspondence between connected coverings of $X$ and conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of $X$.\hspace*{\fill} [5]
