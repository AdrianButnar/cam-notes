\section{Introduction}
Linear analysis is the study of (infinite dimensional) vector spaces with extra structure (eg. a norm or inner product) that allows us to do analysis. We will be interested also in linear operators on spaces of functions.

\section{Normed vector spaces}
In IB Linear Analysis, we have studied vector spaces in quite a lot of detail. However, just knowing that something is a vector space usually isn't too helpful. Often, we would want the vector space to have some additional structure. The first structure we will study is a \emph{norm}.

\begin{defi}[Normed vector space]
  A \emph{normed vector space} is a pair $(V, \|\cdot \|)$, where $V$ is a vector space over a field $\F$ and $\|\cdot \|$ is a function $\|\cdot \|: V \mapsto \R$, known as the \emph{norm}, satisfying
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\|v\| \geq 0$ for all $v\in V$, with equality iff $v = 0$.
    \item $\| \lambda v\| = |\lambda| \|v\|$ for all $\lambda \in \F, v\in V$.
    \item $\|v + w\| \leq \|v\| + \|w\|$ for all $v, w \in V$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}
Intuitively, we think of $\|v\|$ as the ``length'' or ``magnitude'' of the vector.

\begin{eg}
  Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space, and $\{e_1, \cdots, e_n\}$ a basis. Then, for any $v = \sum_{i = 1}^n v_i e_i$, we can define a norm as
  \[
    \|v\| = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n v_i^2}.
  \]
\end{eg}

If we are given a norm of a vector space $V$, we immediately obtain two more structures on $V$ for free, namely a metric and a topology.

Recall from IB Metric and Topological Spaces that $(V, d)$ is a metric space if the metric $d: V\times V \to \R$ satisfies
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $d(x, x) = 0$ for all $x\in V$.
  \item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for all $x, y\in V$.
  \item $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$ for all $x, y, z\in V$.
\end{enumerate}
Recall also that a topological spaces is a set $V$ together with a topology (a collection of open subsets) such that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\emptyset$ and $V$ are open subsets.
  \item The union of open subsets is open.
  \item The finite intersection of open subsets is open.
\end{enumerate}
As we have seen in IB Metric and Topological Spaces, a norm on a vector space induces a metric by $d(v, w) = \|v - w\|$. This metric in terms defines a topology on $V$ where the open sets are given by ``$U\subseteq V$ is open iff for any $x\in U$, $\exists \varepsilon$ such that $B(x, \varepsilon) = \{y\in V: d(x, y) < \varepsilon\}\subseteq U$''.

This induced topology is not just a random topology on the vector space. They have the nice property that the vector space operators behave well under this topology.
\begin{prop}
  Addition $+: V\times V \to V$, and scalar multiplication $\cdot: \F \times V \to V$ are continuous with respect to the topology induced by the norm (and the usual product topology).
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U$ be open in $V$. We want to show that $(+)^{-1} (U)$ is open. Let $(v_1, v_2) \in (+)^{-1}(U)$, ie. $v_1 + v_2 \in U$. Since $v_1 + v_2 \in U$, there exists $\varepsilon$ such that $B(v_1 + v_2, \varepsilon) \subseteq U$. By the triangle inequality, we know that $B(v_1, \frac{\varepsilon}{2}) + B(v_2, \frac{\varepsilon}{2}) \subseteq U$. Hence we have $(v_1, v_2) \in B\left((v_1, v_2), \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right) \subseteq (+)^{-1}(U)$. So $(+)^{-1}(U)$ is open.

  Scalar multiplication can be done in a very similar way.
\end{proof}
This motivates the following definition - we can do without the norm, and just require a topology in which addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.
\begin{defi}[Topological vector space]
  A \emph{topological vector space} $(V, \mathcal{U})$ is a vector space $V$ together with a topology $\mathcal{U}$ such that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous maps, and moreover singleton points $\{v\}$ are closed sets.
\end{defi}
The requirement that points are closed is just a rather technical requirement needed in certain proofs. We should, however, not pay too much attention to this when trying to understand it intuitively.

A natural question to ask is: when is a topological vector space \emph{normable}? ie. Given a topological vector space, can we find a norm that induces the topology?

To answer this question, we will first need a few definitions.

\begin{defi}[Absolute convexity]
  Let $V$ be a vector space. Then $C\subseteq V$ is \emph{absolutely convex} (or \emph{balanced convex}) if for any $\lambda, \mu \in \F$ such that $|\lambda| + |\mu| \leq 1$, we have $\lambda C + \mu C \subseteq C$. In other words, if $c_1, c_2 \in C$, we have $\lambda c_1 + \mu c_2 \in C$.
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}
  If $(V, \|\cdot \|)$ is a normed vector space, then $B(t) = B(0, t) = \{v: \|v\| < t\}$ is absolutely convex.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  By triangle inequality.
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Bounded subset]
  Let $V$ be a topological vector space. Then $B\subseteq V$ is \emph{bounded} if for every open neighbourhood $U\subseteq V$ of $0$, there is some $s > 0$ such that $B\subseteq t U$ for all $t > s$.
\end{defi}
At first sight, this might seem like a rather weird definition. Intuitively, this just means that $B$ is bounded if, whenever we take any open set $U$, by enlarging it by a scalar multiple, we can make it fully contain $B$.

\begin{eg}
  $B(t)$ in a normed vector space is bounded.
\end{eg}

\begin{prop}
  A topological vector space $(V, \mathcal{U})$ is normable if and only if there exists an absolutely convex, bounded open neighbourhood of $0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  One direction is obvious - if $V$ is normable, then $B(t)$ is an absolutely convex, bounded open neighbourhood of $0$.

  The other direction is not too difficult as well. We define the Minkowski functional $\mu: V \to \R$ by
  \[
    \mu_C(v) = \inf \{t > 0: v\in tC\},
  \]
  where $C$ is our absolutely convex, bounded open neighbourhood.

  Note that by definition, for any $t < \mu_C(v)$, $v\not\in tC$. On the other hand, by absolute convexity, for any $t > \mu_C(v)$, we have $v\in tC$.

  We now show that this is a norm on $V$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $v = 0$, then $v\in 0C$. So $\mu_C(0) = 0$. On the other hand, suppose $v \not= 0$. Since a singleton point is closed, $U = V\setminus \{v\}$ is an open neighbourhood of $0$. Hence there is some $t$ such that $C\subseteq tU$. Alternatively, $\frac{1}{t}C \subseteq U$. Hence, $v\not\in \frac{1}{t}C$. So $\mu_C (v) \geq \frac{1}{t} > 0$. So $\mu_C (v) = 0$ iff $v = 0$.

    \item We have
      \[
        \mu_C(\lambda v) = \inf \{t> 0: \lambda v\in tC\} = \lambda \inf \{t > 0: v\in tC\} = \lambda \mu_C(v).
      \]
    \item We want to show that
      \[
        \mu_C (v + w) \leq \mu_C(v) + \mu_C(w).
      \]
      This is equivalent to showing that
      \[
        \inf\{t > 0: v + w \in tC\} \leq \inf\{t > 0: v\in tC\} + \inf\{r > 0: w\in :C\}.
      \]
      This is, in turn equivalent to proving that if $v\in tC$ and $w\in rC$, then $(v + w)\in (t + r)C$.

      Let $v' = v/t, w' = w/r$. Then we want to show that if $v' \in C$ and $w' \in C$, then $\frac{1}{(t + r)}(t v' + r w') \in C$. This is exactly what is required by convexity. So done.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
In fact, the condition of absolute convexity can be replaced ``convex'', where ``convex'' means for every $t\in [0, 1]$, $tC + (1 - t)C \subseteq C$. This is since for every convex bounded $C$, we can find always find a absolutely convex bounded $\tilde{C} \subseteq C$, which is something not hard to prove.

Among all normed spaces, some are particularly nice, known as Banach spaces.
\begin{defi}[Banach spaces]
  A normed vector space is a \emph{Banach space} if it is complete as a metric space, ie. every Cauchy sequence converges.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A finite dimensional vector space (which is isomorphic to $\F^n$ for some $n$) is Banach.
    \item Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Then let
      \[
        B(X) = \{f: X\to \R\text{ such that }f\text{ is bounded}\}.
      \]
      This is obviously a vector space, and we can define the norm be $\|f\| = \sup_{x\in X}f(x)$. It is easy to show that this is a norm. It is less trivial to show that this is a Banach space.

      Let $\{f_n\}\subseteq B(X)$ be a Cauchy sequence. Then for any $x$, $\{f_n(x)\}\subseteq \R$ is also Cauchy. So we can define $f(x) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty}f_n(x)$.

      To show that $f_n \to f$, let $\varepsilon > 0$. By definition of $f_n$ being Cauchy, there is some $N$ such that for any $n, m > N$ and any fixed $x$, we have $|f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \varepsilon$. Take the limit as $m \to \infty$. Then $f_m(x) \to f(x)$. So  $|f_n(x) - f(x)| \leq \varepsilon$. Since this is true for all $x$, for any $n > N$, we must have $\|f_n - f\| \leq \varepsilon$. So $f_n \to f$.

    \item Define $X$ as before, and let
      \[
        C(X) = \{f: X\to \R\text{ such that }f\text{ is continuous}\}.
      \]
      Since any continuous $f$ is bounded, so $C(X) \subseteq B(X)$. We define the norm as before.

      Since we know that $C(X)\subseteq B(X)$, to show that $C(X)$ is Banach, it suffices to show that $C(X) \subseteq B(X)$ is closed, ie. if $f_n \to f$, $f_n \in C(X)$, then $f\in C(X)$, ie. the uniform limit of a continuous function is continuous. Proof can be found in IB Analysis II.
    \item For $1 \leq p < \infty$, define
      \[
        \hat{L}_p ([0, 1]) = \{f: [0, 1] \to \R \text{ such that }f\text{ is continuous}\}.
      \]
      We define the norm $\|\cdot \|_{\hat{L}_p}$ by
      \[
        \|f\|_{\hat{L}_p} = \left(\int_0^1 |f|^p \;\d x\right)^{1/p}.
      \]
      It is easy to show that $\hat{L}_p$ is indeed a vector space, and we now check that this is a norm.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\|f\|_{\hat{L}_p} \geq 0$ is obvious. Also, suppose that $\|f\|_{\hat{L}_p} = 0$. Then we must have $f = 0$. Otherwise, if $f\not = 0$, say $f(x) = \varepsilon$ for some $x$. Then there is some $\delta$ such that for any $y\in (x - \delta, x + \delta)$, we have $\|f(y)\| \geq \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. Hence
          \[
            \|f\|_{\hat{L}_p} = \left(\int_0^1 |f|^p \;\d x\right)^{1/p} \geq \left[2\delta\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^p\right]^{1/p} > 0.
          \]
        \item $\|\lambda f\| = |\lambda|\|f\|$ is obvious
        \item The triangle inequality is the exactly what the Minkowski inequality says, which is in the example sheet.
      \end{enumerate}
      It turns out that $\hat{L}_p$ is \emph{not} a Banach space. We can brute-force a hard proof here, but we will later develop some tools that allow us to prove this much more easily.

      Hence, we define $L_p([0, 1])$ to be the completion of $\hat{L}_p ([0, 1])$. In IID Probability and Measure, we will show that $L_p([0, 1])$ is in fact the space
      \[
        L_p([0, 1]) = \left\{f: [0, 1] \to \R\text{ such that } \int_0^1 |f|^p \;\d x < \infty\right\}/{\sim},
      \]
      where the integral is the Lebesgue integral, and we are quotienting by the relation $f\sim g$ if $f = g$ Lebesgue almost everywhere. You will understand what these terms mean in the IID Probability and Measure course.

    \item $\ell_p$ spaces: for $p\in [1, \infty)$, define
        \[
          \ell_p (\F) = \left\{(x_1, x_2, \cdots): x_i \in \F, \sum_{i = 1}^\infty |x_i|^p < \infty\right\},
        \]
        with the norm
        \[
          j|x\|_{\ell_p} = \left(\sum_{i = 1}^\infty |x_i|^p\right)^{1/p}.
        \]
        It should be easy to check that this is a normed vector space. Moreover, this is a Banach space. Proof is in example sheet.
      \item $\ell_\infty$ space: we define
        \[
          \ell_\infty = \left\{(x_1, x_2, \cdots): x_i\in \F, \sup_{i\in \N} |x_i| < \infty\right\}
        \]
        with norm
        \[
          \|x\|_{\ell_\infty} = \sup_{i\in \N}|x_i|.
        \]
        Again, this is a Banach space.
      \item Let $B = B(1)$ be the unit open ball in $\R^n$. Define $C(B)$ to be the set of continuous functions $f: B\to \R$. Note that unlike in our previous example, these functions need not be bounded. So our previous norm cannot be applied. However, we can still define a topology as follows:

        Let $\{K_i\}_{i = 1}^\infty$ be a sequence of compact subsets of $B$ such that $K_i \subseteq K_{i + 1}$ and $\bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty = B$. We define the basis to include
        \[
          \left\{f \in C(B): \sup_{x \in K_i} |f(x)| < \frac{1}{m}\right\}
        \]
        for each $m, i = 1, 2, \cdots$, as well as the translations of these sets.

        This weird basis is chosen such that $f_n \to f$ in this topology iff $f_n \to f$ uniformly in every compact set. It can be showed that this is not normable.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\subsection{Bounded linear maps}
Now let $X, Y$ be normed vector spaces, and $\mathcal{L}(X, Y)$ be the set of linear maps from $X$ to $Y$.

\begin{defi}[Bounded linear map]
  $T: X\to Y$ is a \emph{bounded linear map} if there is a constant $C > 0$ such that $\|Tx\|_Y \leq C\|x\|_X$ for all $x\in X$. We write $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ for the set of bounded linear maps from $X$ to $Y$.
\end{defi}
This is equivalent to saying $T(B_X(1)) \subseteq B_Y(C)$ for some $C > 0$. This also equivalent to saying that $T(B)$ is bounded for every bounded subset $B$ of $X$. Note that this final characterization is also valid when we just have a topological vector space.

How does boundedness relate to the topological structure of the vector spaces? It turns out that boundedness is the same as continuity.

\begin{prop}
  Let $X$, $Y$ be normed vector spaces, $T: X\to Y$ a linear map. Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $T$ is continuous.
    \item $T$ is continuous at 0.
    \item $T$ is bounded.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  (i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii) is obvious.

  (ii) $\Rightarrow $ (iii): Consider $B_Y(1) \subseteq Y$, the unit open ball. Since $T$ is continuous at $0$, $T^{-1}(B_Y(1))\subseteq X$ is open. Hence there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_X(\varepsilon) \subseteq T^{-1}(B_Y(1))$. So $T(B_x(\varepsilon)) \subseteq B_Y(1)$. So $B_X(1) \subseteq B_Y\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. So $T$ is bounded.

  (iii) $\Rightarrow$ (i): Let $\varepsilon > 0$. Then $\|T x_1 - T x_2\|_Y = \|T(x_1 - x_2)\|_Y \leq C\|x_1 - x_2\|_X$. This is less than $\varepsilon$ if $\|x_1 - x_2\| < C^{-1}\varepsilon$. So done.
\end{proof}

Using the obvious operations, $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ can be made a vector space. What about a norm?

\begin{defi}[Norm on $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$]
  Let $T: X\to Y$ be a bounded linear map. Define $\|T\|_{\mathcal{B}(X, Y)}$ by
  \[
    \|T\|_{\mathcal{B}(X, Y)} = \sup_{\|x\| \leq 1} \|T x\|_Y.
  \]
\end{defi}
Alternatively, this is the minimum $C$ such that $\|Tx\|_Y \leq C\|x\|_X$ for all $x$. In particular, we have
\[
  \|Tx\|_Y \leq \|T\|_{\mathcal{B}(X, Y)}\|x\|_X.
\]
\subsection{Dual spaces}
We will frequently be interested in one particular case of $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$.
\begin{defi}[Dual space]
  Let $V$ be a normed vector space. The \emph{dual space} is
  \[
    V^* = \mathcal{B}(V, \F).
  \]
  We call the elements of $V^*$ \emph{functionals}. The \emph{algebraic dual} of $V$ is
  \[
    V' = \mathcal{L}(V, \F),
  \]
  where we do not require boundedness.
\end{defi}

One particularly nice property of the dual is that $V^*$ is always a Banach space.

\begin{prop}
  Let $V$ be a normed vector space. Then $V^*$ is a Banach space.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\{T_i\} \in V^*$ is a Cauchy sequence. We define $T$ as follows: for any $v\in V$, $\{T_i(v)\}\subseteq \F$ is Cauchy sequence. Since $\F$ is complete (it is either $\R$ or $\C$), we can define $T: V\to \R$ by
  \[
    T(v) = \lim_{n \to \infty}T_n (v).
  \]
  Our objective is to show that $T_i \to T$. The first step is to show that we indeed have $T \in V^*$, ie. $T$ is a bounded map.

  Let $\|v\| \leq 1$. Pick $\varepsilon = 1$. Then there is some $N$ such that for all $i > N$, we have
  \[
    |T_i(v) - T(v)| < 1.
  \]
  Then we have
  \begin{align*}
    |T(v)| &\leq |T_i(v) - T(v)| + |T_i(V)| \\
    &< 1 + \|T_i\|_{V^*}\|v\|_V\\
    & \leq 1 + \|T_i\|_{V^*}\\
    &\leq 1 + \sup_i \|T_i\|_{V^*}
  \end{align*}
  Since $T_i$ is Cauchy, $\sup \|T_i\|_{V^*}$ is bounded. Since this bound does not depend on $v$ (and $N$), we get that $T$ is bounded.

  Now we want to show that $\|T_i - T\|_{V^*} \to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.

  For arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$, there is some $N$ such that for all $i, j > N$, we have
  \[
    \|T_i - T_j\|_{V^*} < \varepsilon.
  \]
  In particular, for any $v$, we have
  \[
    |T_i(v) - T_j(v)| < \varepsilon.
  \]
  Taking the limit as $j\to \infty$, we obtain
  \[
    |T_i(v) - T(v)| \leq \varepsilon.
  \]
  Since this is true for any $v$, we have
  \[
    \|T_i - T\|_{V^*} \leq \varepsilon.
  \]
  for all $i > N$. So $T_i \to T$.
\end{proof}
Exercise: in general, for $X, Y$ normed vector spaces, what condition on $X$ and $Y$ guarantees that $\mathcal{B}(X, Y)$ is a Banach space?

\subsection{Adjoint}
The idea of the adjoint is given a $T\in \mathcal{B}(X, Y)$, produce an \emph{adjoint} $T^*\in \mathcal{B}(Y^*, X^*)$.

There is really only one (non-trivial) natural way of doing this. First we can think about what $T^*$ should do. It takes in something from $Y^*$ and produces something in $X^*$. By the definition of the dual space, this is equivalent to taking in a function $g: Y \to \F$ and returning a function $T^*(g): X\to \F$.

To produce this $T^*(g)$, the only things we are allowed to use are $T: X\to Y$ and $g: Y\to \F$. Thus the only option we have is to define $T^*(g)$ as the composition $g\circ T$, or $T^*(g)(x) = g(T(x))$ (we also have a silly option of producing the zero map regardless of input, but this is silly). Indeed, this is the definition of the adjoint.

\begin{defi}[Adjoint]
  Let $X, Y$ be normal vector spaces. Given $T\in \mathcal{B}(X, Y)$, we define the \emph{adjoint} of $T$, denoted $T^*$, as a map $T^*\in \mathcal{B}(Y^*, X^*)$ given by
  \[
    T^*(g)(x) = g(T(x))
  \]
  for $x \in X$, $y\in Y^*$. Alternatively, we can write
  \[
    T^*(g) = g\circ T.
  \]
\end{defi}
It is easy to show that our $T^*$ is indeed linear. We now show it is bounded.

\begin{prop}
  $T^*$ is bounded.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  We want to show that $\|T^*\|_{\mathcal{B}(Y^*, X^*)}$ is finite. For simplicity, the supremum is assumed to be taken over non-zero elements of the space. We have
  \begin{align*}
    \|T^*\|_{\mathcal{B}(Y^*, X^*)} &= \sup_{g\in Y^*}\frac{\|T^*(g)\|_{X^*}}{\|g\|_{Y^*}}\\
    &= \sup_{g\in Y^*}\sup_{x\in X}\frac{|T^*(g)(x)|/\|x\|_X}{\|g\|_{Y^*}}\\
    &= \sup_{g\in Y^*}\sup_{x\in X} \frac{|g(Tx)|}{\|g\|_{Y^*}\|x\|_X}\\
    &\leq \sup_{g\in Y^*}\sup_{x\in X} \frac{\|g\|_{Y^*}\|Tx\|_Y}{\|g\|_{Y^*}\|x\|_X}\\
    &\leq \sup_{x\in X} \frac{\|T\|_{\mathcal{B}(X, Y)}\|x\|_X}{\|x\|_X}\\
    &= \|T\|_{\mathcal{B}(X, Y)}
  \end{align*}
  So it is finite.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The double dual}
\begin{defi}[Double dual]
  Let $V$ be a normed vector space. Define $V^{**} = (V^*)^*$.
\end{defi}

We want to define a map $\phi: V\to V^{**}$. Again, we can reason about what we expect this function to do. It takes in a $v\in V$, and produces a $\phi(v) \in V^{**}$. Expanding the definition, this gives a $\phi(v): V^* \to \F$. Hence this $\phi(v)$ takes in a $g\in V^*$, and returns a $\phi(v)(g)\in \F$.

This is easy. Since $g \in V^*$, we know that $g$ is a function $g: V\to \F$. Given this function $g$ and a $v\in V$, it is easy to produce a $\phi(v)(g)\in \F$. Just apply $g$ on $v$:
\[
  \phi(v)(g) = g(v).
\]
\begin{prop}
  Let $\phi: V\to V^{**}$ be defined by $\phi(v)(g) = g(v)$. Then $\phi$ is a bounded linear map and $\|\phi\|_{\mathcal{B}(V, V^*)} \leq 1$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Again, we are taking supremum over non-zero elements. We have
  \begin{align*}
    \|\phi\|_{\mathcal{B}(V, V^*)} &= \sup_{v\in V} \frac{\|\phi(v)\|_{V^{**}}}{\|v\|_V}\\
    &= \sup_{v\in V} \sup_{g\in V^*}\frac{|\phi(v)(g)|}{\|v\|_V\|g\|_{V^*}}\\
    &= \sup_{v\in V}\sup_{g\in V^*}\frac{|g(v)|}{\|v\|_V\|g\|_{V^*}}\\
    &\leq 1.

In fact, we will later show that $\|\phi_{\mathcal{B}(V, V^*)} = 1$.

\subsection{Isomorphism}
So far, we have discussed a lot about bounded linear maps, which are ``morphisms'' between normed vector spaces. It is thus natural to come up with the notion of isomorphism.

\begin{defi}[Isomorphism]
  Let $X, Y$ be normed vector spaces. Then $T: X\to Y$ is an \emph{isomorphism} if it is a bounded linear map with a bounded linear inverse (ie. it is a homeomorphism).

  We say $X$ and $Y$ are \emph{isomorphic} if there is an isomorphism $T: X\to Y$.

  We say that $T: X\to Y$ is an \emph{isometric} isomorphism if $T$ is an isomorphism and $\|Tx\|_Y = \|x\|_X$ for all $x\in X$.

  $X$ and $Y$ are \emph{isometrically isomorphic} if there is an isometric isomorphism between them.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
  Consider a finite-dimensional space $\F^n$ with standard basis $\{e_1, \cdots, e_n\}$. For any $v = \sum v_i e_i$, the norm is defined by
  \[
    \|v\| = \left(\sum v_i^2\right)^{1/2}.
  \]
  Then any $g\in V^*$ is determined by $g(e_i)$ for $i = 1, \cdots, n$. We want to show that there are no restrictions on what $g(e_i)$ can be, ie. whatever values I assign to them, $g$ will still be bounded. We have
  \begin{align*}
    \|g\|_{V^*} &= \sup_{v\in V}\frac{|g(v)|}{\|v\|}\\
    &\leq \sup_{v\in V}\frac{\sum |v_i||g(e_i)|}{(\sum |v_i|^2)^{1/2}}\\
    &\leq C\sup_{v\in V}\frac{(\sum |v_i|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}}{(\sum|v_i|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}}\left(\sup_i |g(e_i)|\right)\\
    &= C\sup_i |g(e_i)|
  \end{align*}
  for some $C$, where the second-to-last line is due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

  The supremum is finite since $f$ is finite dimensional.

  So $g$ is uniquely determined by a list of values $(g(e_1), g(e_2), \cdots, g(e_n))$. So it has dimension $n$. Therefore, $V^*$ is isomorphic to $\F^n$. By the same lines of argument, $V^{**}$ is isomorphic to $\F^n$.

  In fact, we can show that $\phi: V\to V^{**}$ by $\phi(v)(g) = g(v)$ is an isometric isomorphism (this is not true for general normed vector spaces. Just pick $V$ to be incomplete, then $V$ and $V^{**}$ cannot be isomorphic since $V^{**}$ is complete).

\begin{eg}
  Consider $\ell_p$ for $p\in [1, \infty)$. What is $\ell_p^*$?

    Suppose $q$ is the \emph{conjugate exponent} of $p$, ie.
    \[
      \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{p} = 1.
    \]
    (if $p = 1$, define $q = \infty$) It is easy to see that $\ell_q \subseteq \ell_p^*$ by the following:

    Suppose $(x_1, x_2, \cdots) \in \ell_p$, and $(y_1, y_2, \cdots)\in \ell_q$. Define $y(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty x_i y_i$. We will show that $y$ defined this way is a bounded linear map. Linearity is easy to see, and boundedness comes from the fact that
    \[
      \|y\|_{\ell_p^*} = \sup_{x}\frac{\|y(x)\|}{\|x\|_{\ell_p}} = \sup_{x} \frac{\sum x_i y_i}{\|x\|_{\ell_p}} \leq \sup \frac{\|x\|_{\ell_p}\|y\|_{\ell_q}}{\|x\|_{\ell_p}} = \|y\|_p,
    \]
    by the H\"older's inequality. So every $(y_i) \in \ell_q$ determines a bounded linear map. In fact, we can show $\ell_p$ is isomorphic to $\ell_q$.
