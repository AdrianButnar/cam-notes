The ``Langlands programme'' is a far-ranging series of conjectures describing the connections between automorphic forms on the one hand, and algebraic number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry on the other. In these lectures we will give an introduction to some aspects of this programme.

\subsubsection*{Pre-requisites}
The course will follow on naturally from the Michaelmas term courses \emph{Algebraic Number Theory} and \emph{Modular Forms and L-Functions}, and knowledge of them will be assumed. Some knowledge of algebraic geometry will be required in places.
