\section{Introduction}
In the differential equations class, we learnt how to do calculus in one dimension (mostly). However, (apparently) the world has more than one dimension. We live in a 3 (or 4) dimensional worlds, and string theorists think that the world have more than 10 dimensions. In this course, we are mostly going to learn about doing calculus in many dimensions. In the last few lectures, we are going to learn about Cartesian tensors, which is a generalization of vectors.

Note that throughout the course (and lecture notes), summation convention is implied unless otherwise stated.

\section{Derivatives and coordinates}
\subsection{Differentiable functions \texorpdfstring{$\R\to\R^n$}{R to Rn}}
\begin{defi}
  A \emph{vector function} is a function $\mathbf{F}: \R\to \R^n$.
\end{defi}

While we used to define a derivative as a limit and a function as differentiable if the derivative exists, we now want to do it in a way that can capture differentiability in a way that is easily extensible to vector functions.

We say a function $f(x)$ is differentiable if, when we perturb its argument $x$ slightly by $\delta x$, then the change in $f(x)$ is proportional to $\delta x$, where ``proportional to'' means equal to ``something'' times $\delta x$, and the ``something'' can be anything from a scalar to a matrix. Then we call that ``something'' the derivative.

In particular, for vector functions, we define:
\begin{defi}[Derivative of vector function]
  A vector function $\mathbf{F}(x)$ is \emph{differentiable} if
  \[
    \delta \mathbf{F} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\mathbf{F}(x + \delta x)- \mathbf{F}(x) = \mathbf{F}'(x)\delta u + o(\delta x)
  \]
  for some $\mathbf{F}'(x)$. $\mathbf{F}'(x)$ is called the \emph{derivative} of $\mathbf{F}(x)$.

  Clearly, if $\mathbf{F}'(x)$ exists, then it is given by
  \[
    \mathbf{F}' = \frac{\d \mathbf{F}}{\d x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{1}{\delta x}[\mathbf{F}(x + \delta x) - \mathbf{F}(x)].
  \]
\end{defi}
Using differential notation, the differentiability condition can be written as
\[
  \d\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}'(x)\d x.
\]

Given a basis $\mathbf{e}_i$ that is independent of $x$, vector differentiation is performed componentwise, i.e.
\begin{prop}
 \[
   \mathbf{F}'(x) = F'_i(x)\mathbf{e}_i.
 \]
\end{prop}
Leibnitz identities hold for the products of scalar and vector functions.
\begin{prop}
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\d}{\d t}(f\mathbf{g}) &= \frac{\d f}{\d t}\mathbf{g} + f\frac{\d \mathbf{g}}{\d t}\\
    \frac{\d}{\d t}(\mathbf{g}\cdot \mathbf{h}) &= \frac{\d \mathbf{g}}{\d t}\cdot \mathbf{h} + \mathbf{g}\cdot \frac{\d \mathbf{h}}{\d t}\\
    \frac{\d}{\d t}(\mathbf{g}\times \mathbf{h}) &= \frac{\d \mathbf{g}}{\d t}\times \mathbf{h} + \mathbf{g}\times \frac{\d \mathbf{h}}{\d t}
  \end{align*}
  Note that the order of multiplication must be retained in the case of the cross product.
\end{prop}

\begin{eg}
  Consider a particle with mass $m$. It has position $\mathbf{r}(t)$, velocity $\dot{\mathbf{r}}(t)$ and acceleration $\ddot{\mathbf{r}}$. Its momentum is $\mathbf{p} = m\dot{\mathbf{r}}(t)$.

  \note that derivatives with respect to $t$ are usually denoted by dots instead of dashes.

  If $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})$ is the force on a particle, then Newton's second law states that
  \[
    \dot{\mathbf{p}} = m\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}).
  \]
  We can define the angular momentum about the origin to be
  \[
    \mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{r} \times \dot{\mathbf{r}}.
  \]
  If we want to know how the angular momentum changes over time, then
  \[
    \dot{\mathbf{L}} = m\dot{\mathbf{r}}\times \dot{\mathbf{r}} + m\mathbf{r}\times \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = m + \mathbf{r}\times \ddot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{F}.
  \]
  which is the \emph{torque} of $\mathbf{F}$ about the origin.
\end{eg}

\subsection{Differentiable functions \texorpdfstring{$\R^n\to \R$}{Rn to R}}
\begin{defi}
  A \emph{scalar function} is a function $f: \R^n \to \R$.
\end{defi}

Before we define the derivative of a scalar function, we have to first define what it means to take a limit of a vector.
\begin{defi}[Limit of vector]
  The \emph{limit of vectors} is defined using the norm. So $\mathbf{v}\to \mathbf{c}$ iff $|\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{c}| \to 0$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Gradient of scalar function]
  A scalar function $f(\mathbf{r})$ is \emph{differentiable} at $\mathbf{r}$ if
  \[
    \delta f \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} f(\mathbf{r} + \delta \mathbf{r}) - f(\mathbf{r}) = (\nabla f)\cdot \delta \mathbf{r} + o(\delta \mathbf{r})
  \]
  for some vector $\nabla f$, the \emph{gradient} of $f$ at $\mathbf{r}$.
\end{defi}
Taking $\delta \mathbf{r} = h\mathbf{n}$, with $\mathbf{n}$ a unit vector,
\[
  f(\mathbf{r} + h\mathbf{n}) - f(\mathbf{r}) = \nabla f \cdot (h\mathbf{n}) + o(h),
\]
which gives
\begin{defi}[Directional derivative]
  The \emph{directional derivative} of $f$ along $\mathbf{n}$ is
  \[
    \mathbf{n}\cdot \nabla f = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h}[f(\mathbf{r} + h\mathbf{n}) - f(\mathbf{r})],
  \]
  It refers to how fast $f$ changes when we move in the direction of $\mathbf{n}$.
\end{defi}
In particular, the directional derivative is maximized when $\mathbf{n}$ is in the direction of $\nabla f$. So $\nabla f$ points in the direction of greatest slope.

To evaluate $\nabla f$, suppose we have an orthonormal basis $\mathbf{e}_i$. Setting $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{e}_i$ in the above equation, we obtain
\[
  \mathbf{e}_i \cdot \nabla f = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}[f(\mathbf{r} + h\mathbf{e}_i) - f(\mathbf{r})] = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}.
\]
Hence 
\begin{thm}
  The gradient is
  \[
    \nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\mathbf{e}_i
  \]
\end{thm}

Hence we can write the condition of differentiability as
\[
  \delta f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\delta x_i + o(\delta x).
\]
In differential notation, we write
\[ 
  df = \nabla f\cdot \d \mathbf{r} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\d x_i,
\]
which is the chain rule for partial derivatives.

\begin{eg}
  Take $f(x, y, z) = x + e^{xy}\sin z$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \nabla f &= \left(\frac{\partial f}{\varphi x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right)\\
    &= (1 + ye^{xy}\sin z, xe^{xy}\sin z, e^{xy}\cos z)
  \end{align*}

  At  $(x, y, z) = (0, 1, 0)$, $\nabla f = (1, 0, 1)$. So $f$ increases/decreases most rapidly for $\mathbf{n} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, 1)$ with a rate of change of $\pm \sqrt{2}$. There is no change in $f$ if $\mathbf{n}$ is perpendicular to $\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, 1)$.
\end{eg}

Now suppose we have a scalar function $f(\mathbf{r})$ and we want to consider the rate of change along a path $\mathbf{r}(u)$. A change $\delta u$ produces a change $\delta \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}' \delta u + o(\delta u)$, and
\[
  \delta f = \nabla f\cdot \delta \mathbf{r} + o(|\delta \mathbf{r}|) = \nabla f\cdot \mathbf{r}'(u)\delta u + o(\delta u).
\]
This shows that $f$ is differentiable as a function of $u$ and
\begin{thm}[Chain rule]
  Given a function $f(\mathbf{r}(u))$,
  \[
    \d f = \nabla f\cdot \d \mathbf{r} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \d x_i.
  \]
\end{thm}

\subsection{Differentiable functions \texorpdfstring{$\R^n\to \R^m$}{Rn to Rm}}
So far, we have only considered functions $\R \to \R^n$ and $\R^n \to \R$. We can also consider vector fields:
\begin{defi}[Vector field]
  A \emph{vector field} is a function $\mathbf{F}: \R^n\to \R^m$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Derivative of vector field]
  A vector field $\mathbf{F}: \R^n \to \R^m$ is differentiable if
  \[
    \delta \mathbf{F} \stackrel{def}{=} \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x} + \delta\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{F}(\delta\mathbf{x}) = M\delta\mathbf{x} + o(\delta \mathbf{x})
  \]
  for some $n\times m$ matrix $M$. $M$ is the \emph{derivative} of $\mathbf{F}$.
\end{defi}

Given an arbitrary function $\mathbf{F}: \R^n \to \R^m$ that maps $\mathbf{x}\mapsto \mathbf{y}$ and a choice of basis, we can write $\mathbf{F}$ as a set of $m$ functions $y_j = F_j(\mathbf{x})$ such that $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_m)$. Then
\[
  \d y_j = \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_i} \d x_i.
\]
and we can write the derivative as
\begin{thm}
  The derivative of $\mathbf{F}$ is given by
  \[
    M_{ji} =\frac{\partial y_j}{\partial x_i}.
  \]
\end{thm}

\begin{defi}
  A function is \emph{smooth} if it can be differentiated any number of times, i.e. if all partial derivatives exist and are totally symmetric in $i, j$ and $k$ (i.e. the differential operation is commutative).
\end{defi}
The functions we will consider will be smooth except where things obviously go wrong (e.g. $f(x) = 1/x$ at $x = 0$).

\subsection{Chain rule}
\begin{thm}[Chain rule]
  Suppose $g: \R^p\to\R^n$ and $f: \R^n \to \R^m$. Suppose that the coordinates of the vectors in $\R^p, \R^n$ and $\R^m$ are $u_a, x_i$ and $y_r$ respectively. By the chain rule,
  \[
    \frac{\partial y_r}{\partial u_a} = \frac{\partial y_r}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial u_a},
  \]
  with summation implied. Writing in matrix form,
  \[
    M(f\circ g)_{ra} = M(f)_{ri}M(g)_{ia}.
  \]
  Alternatively, in operator form,
  \[
    \frac{\partial}{\partial u_a} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial u_a}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}.
  \]
\end{thm}

\subsection{Inverse functions}
Suppose $g, f: \R^n \to \R^n$ are inverse functions, i.e. $g\circ f = f\circ g = \id$. Suppose that $f(\mathbf{x}) =\mathbf{u}$ and $g(\mathbf{u}) = \mathbf{x}$.

Since the derivative of the identity function is the identity matrix (if you differentiate $\mathbf{x}$ wrt to $\mathbf{x}$, you get $1$), we must have
\[
  M(f\circ g) = I.
\]
Therefore we know that 
\[
  M(g) = M(f)^{-1}.
\]
We derive this result more formally by noting
\[
  \frac{\partial u_b}{\partial u_a} = \delta_{ab}.
\]
So by the chain rule,
\[
  \frac{\partial u_b}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial u_a} = \delta_{ab},
\]
i.e. $M(f\circ g) = I$.

In the $n = 1$ case, it is the familiar result that $\d u/\d x = 1/(\d x/\d u)$.

\begin{eg}
  For $n = 2$, write $u_1 = \rho$, $u_2 =\varphi$ and let $x_1 = \rho \cos \varphi$ and $x_2 = \rho \sin \varphi$. Then the function used to convert between the coordinate systems is $g(u_1, u_2) = (u_2\cos u_1, u_2\sin u_1)$

  Then
  \begin{align*}
    M(g) &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \partial x_1/\partial \rho & \partial x_1/\partial \varphi\\
      \partial x_2/\partial \rho & \partial x_2/\partial \varphi
    \end{pmatrix}
    &=
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \cos\varphi & -\rho\sin \varphi\\
      \sin \varphi & \rho \cos \varphi
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align*}

  We can invert the relations between $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(\rho, \varphi)$ to obtain
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi &= \tan^{-1} \frac{x_2}{x_1}\\
    \rho &= \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}
  \end{align*}

  We can calculate
  \[
    M(f) = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \partial\rho/\partial x_1 & \partial\rho/\partial x_2\\
      \partial\varphi/\partial x_1 & \partial\varphi/\partial x_2\\
    \end{pmatrix}
     = M(g)^{-1}.
  \]

  These matrices are known as Jacobians matrices, and their determinants are known as the Jacobians. 
\end{eg}
Note that
\[
  \det M(f)\det M(g) = 1.
\]
\subsection{Coordinate systems}
Now we can apply the results above the changes of coordinates on Euclidean space. Suppose $x_i$ are the coordinates are Cartesian coordinates. Then we can define an arbitrary new coordinate system $u_a$ in which each coordinate $u_a$ is a function of $\mathbf{x}$. For example, we can define the plane polar coordinates $\rho, \varphi$ by
\[
  x_1 = \rho\cos\varphi, \quad x_2 = \rho\sin \varphi.
\]
However, note that $\rho$ and $\varphi$ are not components of a position vector, i.e. they are not the ``coefficients'' of basis vectors like $\mathbf{r} = x_1\mathbf{e}_1 + x_2\mathbf{e}_2$ are. But we can associate related basis vectors that point to directions of increasing $\rho$ and $\varphi$:
\[
  \mathbf{e}_\rho = \cos \varphi\, \mathbf{e}_1 + \sin \varphi\, \mathbf{e}_2,\quad \mathbf{e}_\varphi = -\sin \varphi\, \mathbf{e}_1 + \cos \varphi\, \mathbf{e}_2.
\]
% Insert diagram
However, these basis vectors vary with position and are undefined at the origin.

In three dimensions, we have cylindrical polars and spherical polars.

\section{Curves and Line}
\subsection{Parametrised curves, lengths and arc length}
\begin{defi}[Parametrisation of curve]
  Given a curve $C$ in $\R^n$, a \emph{parametrisation} of it is a continuous and invertible function $\mathbf{r}: D\to \R^n$ for some $D\subseteq \R$ whose image is $C$.

  $\mathbf{r}'(u)$ is a vector tangent to the curve at each point. A parametrization is \emph{regular} if $\mathbf{r}'(u) \not= 0$ for all $u$.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
  The curve
  \[
    \frac{1}{4}x^2 + y^2 = 1, \quad y \geq 0, \quad z = 3.
  \]
  is parametrised by $2\cos u\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \sin u\hat{\mathbf{j}} + 3\hat{\mathbf{k}}$
\end{eg}

If we change $u$ (and hence $\mathbf{r}$) by a small amount, then the distance $|\delta \mathbf{r}|$ is roughly equal to the change in arclength $\delta s$. So $\delta s = |\delta \mathbf{r}| + o(\delta \mathbf{r})$. Then we have
\begin{prop}
  Let $s$ denote the arclength of a curve $\mathbf{r}(u)$. Then
  \[
    \frac{\d s}{\d u} = \pm \left|\frac{\d \mathbf{r}}{\d u}\right| = \pm |\mathbf{r}'(u)|.
  \]
  With the sign determining whether it is in the direction of increasing or decreasing arclength. 
\end{prop}

\begin{eg}
  Consider a helix described by $\mathbf{r}(u) = (3\cos u, 3\sin u, 4u)$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \mathbf{r}'(u) &= (-3,\sin u, 3\cos u, 4)\\
    \frac{\d s}{\d u} &= |\mathbf{r}'(u)| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5
  \end{align*}
  So $s = 5u$. i.e. the arclength from $\mathbf{r}(0)$ and $\mathbf{r}(u)$ is $s = 5u$.
\end{eg}

We can change parametrisation of $\mathbf{r}$ by taking an invertible smooth function $u\mapsto \tilde{u}$, and have a new parametrization $\mathbf{r}(\tilde{u}) = \mathbf{r}(\tilde{u}(u))$. Then by the chain rule,
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\d \mathbf{r}}{\d u} &= \frac{\d \mathbf{r}}{\d \tilde{u}}\times \frac{\d \tilde{u}}{\d u}\\
  \frac{\d \mathbf{r}}{\d \tilde{u}} &= \frac{\d \mathbf{r}}{\d u}/ \frac{\d \tilde{u}}{\d u}
\end{align*}

It is often convenient to use the arclength $s$ as the parameter. Then the tangent vector will always have unit length since the proposition above yields
\[
  |\mathbf{r}'(s)| = \frac{\d s}{\d s} = 1.
\]

\begin{defi}[Scalar line element]
  We say $\d s = \pm |\mathbf{r}'(u)| \d u$ is a \emph{scalar line element} on $C$.
\end{defi}
\subsection{Line integrals of vector fields}
\begin{defi}[Line integral]
  The \emph{line integral} of a smooth vector field $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})$ along a path $C$ parametrised by $\mathbf{r}(u)$ with along the direction (orientation) $ \mathbf{r}(\alpha)\to \mathbf{r}(\beta)$ is
  \[
    \int_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \d \mathbf{r} = \int_\alpha^\beta \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u))\cdot \mathbf{r}'(u)\d u.
  \]
  We say $\d \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}'(u) \d u$ is the \emph{line element} on $C$. Note that the upper and lower limits of the integral are the end point and start point respectively, and $\beta$ is not necessarily larger than $\alpha$. 
\end{defi}
For example, we may be moving a particle from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$ along a curve $C$ under a force field $\mathbf{F}$. Then we may divide the curve into many small segments $\delta \mathbf{r}$. Then for each infinitesimal segment, the force experienced is $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})$ and the work done is $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \d\mathbf{r}$. Then the total work done across the curve is
\[
  \int_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \d \mathbf{r}.
\]

\begin{eg}
  Take $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = (xe^y, z^2, xy)$ and we want find the line integral from $\mathbf{a}=(0, 0, 0)$ to $\mathbf{b}=(1, 1, 1)$. We first integrate along the curve $C_1: \mathbf{r}(u) = (u, u^2, u^3)$. Then $\mathbf{r}'(u) = (1, 2u, 3u^2)$, and $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u)) = (ue^{u^2}, u^6, u^3)$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{C_1} \mathbf{F}\cdot \d\mathbf{r} &= \int_0^1 \mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{r}'(u) \d u\\
    &= \int_0^1 ue^{u^2} + 2u^7 + 3u^5\;\d u\\
    &= \frac{e}{2} -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}\\
    &= \frac{e}{2} + \frac{1}{4}
  \end{align*}
  Now we try to integrate along another curve $C_2: \mathbf{r}(t) = (t, t, t)$. So $\mathbf{r}'(t) = (1,1, 1)$. 
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{C_2} \mathbf{F}\cdot \d \mathbf{r} &= \int \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{r}'(t)\d t)\\
    &= \int_0^1 te^t + 2t^2\; \d t\\
    &= \frac{5}{3}
  \end{align*}
  Note that the line integral depends on the curve $C$ in general, not just $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}$.
\end{eg}

We can also use the arclength $s$ as parameter. Since $\d \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{t}\;\d s$, with $\mathbf{t}$ being the unit tangent vector, we have
\[
  \int_C \mathbf{F}\cdot \d \mathbf{r} = \int_C \mathbf{F}\cdot \mathbf{t}\;\d s.
\]
In addition to integrating a vector field, we can also integrate a scalar function as a function of $s$, $\int_C f(s)\;\d s$. By convention, this is calculated in the direction of increasing $s$. In particular, we have
\[
  \int_C 1\;\d s = \text{length of C}.
\]
\begin{defi}[Closed curve]
  A \emph{closed curve} is a curve with the same start and end point. The line integral along a closed curve is written as $\oint$ and is called the \emph{circulation} of $\mathbf{F}$ around $C$.
\end{defi}
