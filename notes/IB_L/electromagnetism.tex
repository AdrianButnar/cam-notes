\section{Introduction}
Electromagnetism is important.
\subsection{Charge and Current}
The strength of the electromagnetic force experienced by a particle is determined by its \emph{(electric) charge}. The SI unit of charge is the \emph{Columb}. In this course, we assume that the charge can be any real number. However, at the fundamental level, charge is quantised. All particles carry charge $q = ne$ with $n\in \Z$, \footnote{Actually quarks have $n = \pm1/3$ or $\pm2/3$, but when we study quarks, electromagnetism becomes insignificant compared to the strong force. So for all practical purposes we can have $n\in \Z$.} and the basic unit $e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19} $C. For example, the electron has $n = -1$, proton has $n = +1$, neutron = $n = 0$.

In this course, it will be more useful to talk about \emph{charge density} $\rho(\mathbf{x}, t)$. This is the charge per unit volume. The total charge in a region $V$ is
\[
  Q = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{x}, t)\; \d^3 x
\]

The motion of charge is described by the \emph{current} density $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}, t)$. For any surface $S$, the integral
\[
  I = \int_S \mathbf{J}\cdot d\mathbf{S}
\]
counts the charge per unit time passing through $S$. $I$ is called the current, and $\mathbf{J}$ is the ``current per unit area''.

Intuitively, if the charge distribution $\rho (\mathbf{x}, t)$ has velocity $\mathbf{v}(x, t)$, then (neglecting relativistic effects), we have
\[
  \mathbf{J} = \rho \mathbf{v}
\]

\begin{eg}
  A wire is a cylinder of cross-sectional area $A$. Suppose there are $n$ electrons per unit volume. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \rho &= nq = -ne\\
    \mathbf{J} &= nq\mathbf{v}\\
    I &= nqvA
  \end{align*}
\end{eg}

It is well know that charge is conserved. However, we can have a stronger statement- charge is conserved locally: it is not possible that a charge in a box disappears and instantaneously appears on the moon. If it disappears in the box, it must have moved to somewhere nearby.

This is captured by the \emph{continuity equation}
\[
  \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \mathbf{J} = 0
\]
The charge $Q$ in some region $V$ is
\[
  Q = \int_V \rho \;\d^3 x
\]
So
\[
  \frac{\d Q}{\d t} = \int_V \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}\; d^3 x = -\int_V \nabla\cdot \mathbf{J}\; \d^3 x = -\int_S \mathbf{J}\cdot \d S
\]
where the last equality is by the divergence theorem. i.e. the rate of change in charge is the rate of charge flowing out of the point.

We can take $V = \R^3$, the whole of space. If there are no currents at infinity, then
\[
  \frac{\d Q}{\d t} = 0
\]
So the continuity equation implies the conservation of charge.

\subsection{Forces and Fields}
All forces are mediated by \emph{fields}. In physics a \emph{field} is a dynamical quantity which takes values at every point in space and time. The electromagnetic force is mediated by two fields:
\begin{itemize}
  \item electric field $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{x}, t)$
  \item magnetic field $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{x}, t)$
\end{itemize}
Each of these fields is itself a 3-vector. There are two aspects to the force:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Particles create fields
  \item Fields move particles
\end{itemize}
The second aspect is governed by the Lorentz force law:
\[
  \mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})
\]
The first aspect is governed by the \emph{Maxwell equations}.

\begin{align*}
  \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}\\
  \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0\\
  \nabla \times \mathbf{E} +\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} &= 0\\
  \nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = \mu_0 \mathbf{j}
\end{align*}
where
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\varepsilon_0 = \SI{8.85e-12}{\per\metre\cubed\per\kilogram\s\squared\coulomb\squared}$ is the electric constant
  \item $\mu_0 = \SI{4\pi e-6}{\metre\kilogram\per\coulomb\squared}$ is the magnetic constant
\end{itemize}
These equations are special in a mathematical way. In fact, using quantum mechanics and relativity, it can be shown that these are the only equations that can possibly describe electromagnetism
